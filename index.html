       <P>
        <u>1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</u>
            <LI>Opened up the experience for the first time</LI>
            <li>Saw some kind of weird black-white contrasting background that is not just flat but also moving. </li>
            <li>There were also many yellow-orange kinds of circles of different sizes.</li>
            <li>Went ahead with clicking on each of the circles.</li>
            <li>Massive chunk of information popped up on the top left of the webpage </li>
            <li>More circles to click, more paragraphs pop up.</li>
       </P>

       <p>
        <u>2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</u>
        <li>The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the experience was probably 
            the yellow-orange circles that keep on moving around the webpage as that was probably 
            one of the things that stands out the most on the webpage which attracted my eyes to the 
            circles, convincing me to click onto each of the circles like a game with something going to pop 
            out after hitting each of the circles.</li>
        </p2>

        <p>
           <u>3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?</u> 
           <li>I spent most of my time reading each chunk of information the webpage gives out after having 
            to click almost all the circles and that was because after having clicked enough circles and reading 
            what it had said, I feel as if this was kind of a story that was trying to tell me something or 
            rather, what the words that are popping up want to express to me. </li>
        </p3>

        <p>
            <u> 4) What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</u>
            <li>During my two-minute interaction with the experience, the most common action that I had done was 
                probably just clicking each of the circles until there are none left as it would seem to reveal a 
                long narrative story after having completed that action. </li>
        </p4>

        <p>
            <u>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</u>
            <li>I feel as if the intended primary goal of the interactive experience is to help encourage 
                designs to keep moving forward, never giving up and if you fall down, you must get back up
                and continue improving yourself relevant to design. </li>
        </p5>

        <p>
            <u> 6) How does the experience communicate its primary goal?</u>
            <li>The experience communicates its primary goal by creating many individual yellow-orange
                circles which hold a fragment of the story and by clicking on all the circles, it would 
                bring forth a completed story with surprises to come.</li>
        </p6>

        <p>
            <u>7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often are you intended to interact with the experience?</u>
            <li>In the experience, it seems to me that clicking the yellow-orange circles until there are none left seems to be the only thing I can do. 
                Since it is the only interactive activity on the webpage, it wouldn't take long to click all the circles to reveal the rest.</li>

        <p>
            <u>8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</u>
            <li>A metaphor that references the experience’s mental model could be something like “Pain will come to pass” or “Turn the pain into your strength”.</li>
        </p8>

        <p>
            <u>9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</u>
            <li>When I am engaging with this experience, I feel like the reference is suggesting to me that whenever I am in a time of mental pain such 
            as loneliness or sadness, I would have to keep staying strong, and move forward and that pain will no longer hurt you anymore.</li>
        </p9>

        <p>
            <u>10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</u>
            <li>The most frustrating element of the interaction is probably how some of the circles can get so tiny that it takes more than a few clicks to make them disappear. </li>
        </p10>

        <p>
            <u>11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</u>
            <li>The most satisfying element of the interaction was probably how a fragment of a nice story appears every time a circle has been clicked.</li>
